            This page will discuss and address my entire webpage, including my own reasoning for why I have implemented

                website, which is a consistent aspect seen throughout.</p>
            <p>
                By using the same structure and design for each webpage, I have successfully created a seamlessly
                alluring and user-friendly, functional website. This website encompasses every requirement needed for
                this assessment, as well as other aspects to make the website look and feel more appealing. .</p>
            <p> This website was created using the code editor, ‘visual studio code,’ using 4 html pages and 1 CSS page.
                I much preferred the layout of this editor rather than ed, as it was quite easy to learn. </p>

                            heading is formatted using the same div to provide consistency throughout. I have
                            implemented capital letters, 1px spacing between the letters and a margin of 20px, to make
                            the heading stand out more. </td>
                        <td>The main body (<span class="green">highlighted green</span>) consists of many different divs

                            with similar font,
                            formatting and consistency. The reason for so many varieties of divs is because spacing
                            often changes due to the application of lists, tables and images. I have created many divs
                            that are almost the same, such as “wrapper1-4.” Such a similar name reminds me of what the
                            div is used for, but also distinguishes where it goes. .</td>

                            of the page. This
                            is done to make it easier for the viewers to get back to the top of the page, especially if
                            they are on a small device. It is formatted the exact same way on every page to create
                            consistency. </td>

                            table heading. I have also set
                            the width to be 100% to keep the table a consistent size, with a margin on both left and
                            right to be 40px. </td>

        <div class="wrapperp6">
            The navigation bar (nav_links) is comprised of many features that are beneficial for the style,

            formatting and user interactivity of this website. For instance, this navbar is identical, no matter which
            page you are

            on, creating a sleek, clutter free visual effect effect while changing between each page. These features can
            include .current, :Hover which change the colour of the current page to <span class="pink">pink</span> and
            the page you hover
            over to <span class="lightpink">light pink</span>. The width is also “100%” so that when the website is
            zoomed in or seen on different
            devices, it will remain the entire length of the webpage.

        <p>
        <div class="wrapperp8">

            The margin and padding are used for aesthetics and for technical reasons within this webpage. Using
            cascading style sheets, I have created a neat website whereby the margin scales inwards towards the centre
            of the page, depending on the title and text. The implementation of a margin means there isn't text on the
            border of the page and creates a pleasing design for the user. It allows for no text to be cut off from
            being on the edge of the page, as well as formatting the images closer and further away from text.


        </div>
        <div class="smallertitle1">
            <b>Text Formatting</b>
        </div>
        <div class="wrapperp8">
            Similarly to the fundamental elements listed above, text formatting is thorougly important to be formatted
            consistently. I have used separate divs for text to achieve correct spacing around, as text is placed
            in many different areas. I have made sure to reference that the text is similar but with different
            formatting by using specifics divs such as “smalltitle1, smalltitle2” and so on. This allows for me to
            easily identify which text it is, but also allows for the text to be correctly formatted no matter its
            surroundings.

            To further format text and blocks of text, I have used <span class="pink">pink</span> lines,
            “border-top” and “border-bottom,” to
            separate aspects of my webpage. This element allows for text bodies to be separated and provides a clear
            definition of headings. For instance, within the comments page (the page you are viewing) I have
            implemented the <span class="pink">pink</span> line after every major text block, such as Technical,
            Aesthetics and Accessibility.

            <b>Footer</b>
        </div>

        <div class="wrapperp6">
            I have implemented a footer to every webpage of this website, that is consistent and simple. It is quite
            small but contains necessary information such as my own name and the assessment name. The important aspect
            of this footer is the use of a “back to top” message that allows the user to jump straight back up to the
            top of the page. This element is executed by using a “a href #top” that references back to the top of the
            page using “a id=top.” This is a fundamental addition to my website as it allows users to quickly return to
            the top of their current page, which could be difficult if they are on a small device. Above the footer,
            there is another “border-top” line that indicates that the website is completed, as it spans the entire
            width of the page. This technical aspects is quite important as it subtly lets the user know that the
            webpage is finished.

        <div class="smallertitle1">
            <b>Font</b>
        </div>
        <div class="wrapperp6">
            The use of a font-family is a very important technical aspect, as it is a fallback system for the browser.
            If the browser does not support a certain font, it can fallback onto the next font listed in the
            font-family. I have specifically chosen these five fonts and formatted them as shown: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma,
            Geneva, Verdana,

            sans-serif.

            The use of this fallback system allows the website to look as similar to how the author intended for it to
            be, as well as letting people use the website in almost any browser

        <div class="smallertitle1">
            <b>Tables</b>
        </div>
        <div class="wrapperp6">
            I have included a table on the “future” webpage that I have styled using “style=width:100%’, allowing for
            the table to encompass the full scope of the website, no matter the zoom percentage or size of screen that
            the user is viewing it at. The importance of using a percentage rather than a set number of pixels is to
            make sure the table is not cut off or dismantled when using different size devices or zooms. This table has
            a designated border to clearly classify the information that is held within it. I have specified the heading
            of the table by acknowledging “th” to change the background colour to <span class="pink">pink</span>, as
            well as using
            “text-align: center;”. The spacing is set using padding and margin so that the information contained within
            is not cluttered but also doesn’t have too much white space. By using these elements, I have successfully
            defined the table and its headings, which are clear for the user to read.

            The image included in the “Home” page has no border, to create a sleek design and look modern. This image
            includes a “:hover”, that tells the user what the image is called. I have done this so that the user does
            not get confused about what the image is, as it adds context. The text within the hover is aligned in the
            middle of the image using text-align and vertical-align. The image is formatted with a .container and
            .overlay, for the hover to line up. The entire image is formatted this way as it is a pleasant interactive
            aspect for a viewer and fits my own aesthetic of the website.

            scheme,(seen in the image to the right) that is very monochromatic with a pop of colour. This is seen using
            different shades of greys and pinks. The use of such colours provides the user with a clear view of the
            website, with two shades of pink to allow for certain aspects to stand out. This allows the webpage to not
            being overbearing, which is often seen when there is either too much colour or no colour at all. This
            minimalistic design is seen consistently throughout my entire website, which will be further mentioned. The
            interactivity of adding small amounts of colour can greatly improve the viewers' sense of appeal and
            engagement, rather than being plain.

            These fonts are coloured in an off-white colour, rgb(228,230,235), which is slightly darker than white. I
            decided to use this colour as it was less harsh against the contrast of the background colour of #18191a.
            Furhtermore, the dark background colour provides contrast towards everything else shown on the screen, which
            I was contemplating leaving as white, but I felt it was too harsh on the eyes. This colour scheme took
            awhile to decide, as I found a lot of colours clashed or were not sppealing to the eye.

        </div>
        <img src="navbar.jpg" alt="Navigational bar image" class="image8">
        <div class="wrapperp6">

            The navigational bar is designed to be large enough to view at the top of the page, as well as in its fixed
            position. I have implemented the navigational bar to follow the user as they scroll down my page. This
            provides convenience and is appealing to the eye as it is slightly transparent so does not block off text
            behind it. This fixed position reflects quite a modern website, as it is very user friendly, no matter what
            device is used. As well as this, the navigational bar changes colour for what page you are on. The <span
                class="pink">pink</span>, greatly stands out and is a very useful tool for the
            user. I have added a :hover,
            to this navigation bar so that if a user wants to change to a different webpage, it will highlight it in a
            slightly <span class="lightpink">lighter pink</span> All these aspects
            contribute to an appealing navigational
            bar that is VERY user friendly, interactive and engaging.

        <img src="textformat.jpg" alt="An image of the text formatting from the home page" class="image9">
        <div class="wrapperp6">

            The page titles and body content are in descending order for size, as I have previously mentioned. The use
            of margin spacing is a great aspect for the viewer as it is pleasing to the eye and makes headings much more
            obvious, especially if they are the same colour. I have consistently used a “border-bottom” and “border-top”
            to space out and make obvious the heading, footer as well as different tiles within this comment page. I
            have coloured them <span class="pink">pink</span> for them to stand out and look flattering. I have used a
            line that spreads across
            the length of the page that indicated that the page is at the top or bottom, while I have used a 40px margin
            for a line that is only separate bodies of text, as it is only a page break.
            I have consistently adjusted
            the spacing, including margins, padding and alignment for the website to be as aesthetically pleasing as
            possible. This consistently makes each webpage perfectly aligned as you flick through them. without such
            alignment. the webpage would look clunky and be distasteful to the eye.

            <b>Interactivity and Engagement</b>
        </div>
        <div class="wrapperp6">
            I have previously listed all of the interactivity factors within my webpage, within other headings of this
            page. But i will further include them here. Interactivity is a great example implemented for the user, as it
            provides connectred feel for the viewer and also looks very appealing. I have used interactivity in aspects
            such as my navigational bar, images and footer. The engagement of these aspects is important for a user as
            the website is not plain and simple, creating an appealing and seemless website.

            <b>Accessibility</b>

        </div>
        <div class="wrapperp6">
            I have followed the guidelines of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/">W3C Web
                Accessibility Initiative</a> and applied them within my website. This is an important factor as it
            allows for the website to be accessible to anyone

        <img src="alttag.jpg" alt="Alt tag of an image" class="image7">
        <div class="wrapperp6">
            Accessibility is a necessary aspect for website users, so I have implemented alt tags in every single image.
            Alt tags describe the image and appear if the image fails to load on a users screen. Alt tags are very
            important as it allows for screen-readers to describe the image to people who may be visually impaired. It
            also allows for people to find the website by simply searching up the alt tags, which can provide activity
            for a website owner. As well as this, in my first image I have provided a hover aspect which describes what
            the image is. This can be appealing to a viewer as they might be unsure of what the image is.

        <div class="smallertitle1">
            <b>Screen Size</b>
        </div>
        <img src="zoom.jpg" alt="image of the zoom for the webpage" class="image6">
        <div class="wrapperp6">
            To make the entire webpage thoroughly accessible to any on any device, with any screen size, I have used
            size percentages for text, tables and more. This is so these elements are not a fixed size of pixels and
            will adjust when the screen size adjusts, for instance on a phone. If this wasn’t implemented, then people
            on smaller screens might find it hard to view the website as its proper format is not correct. Seen in the
            image provided, I have shown that I have tested the sizing of my website within my browser by changing the
            zoom. I have also tested my website on my iPhone which worked very well.
            <p>
                For accessibility on phones and devices with smaller screens, I have included a “back to top” link, that
                scrolls the user back to the top of the page once interacted with. This can be an important aspect for
                long webpages, as it may take a period of time to scroll through.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="smallertitle5">
            <b>Text</b>
        </div>
        <div class="wrapperp6">
            <p>
                I have also tested that the colours and colour scheme have a good amount of contrast and do not hurt the
                viewer's eyes. This is seen through my use of light grey instead of bright white for the text. I have
                also made sure that no text blurs into the background and that it all fits well together. This is
                especially important for people with visual impairments such as colorblindness, so I have not included
                blue and red, or even prime colours, conjunctively. I have tested this using <a
                    href="https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/">"Color Blindness
                    Simulator"</a> in order to be absolutely sure that my colours have not clashed. This is an important
                aspect as some colours may not be noticeable for people with different visual impairments.

            </p>
            <p>
                The use of indentation is seen consistently and is important for a user as it shows headings and
                subheadings. Having a consistent use of margin and paddings, as well as font size and spacing is a
                necessary aspect for viewers as it allows it to be easier for them to read and is attractive to the eye.
                The font choice allows for accessibility for any browser as I have used a font-family which is a
                fallback system, previously mentioned. These aspects keep the website consistent and user friendly.
