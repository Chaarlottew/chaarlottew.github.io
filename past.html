            <p>I have done quite minimal coding, but have always had an interest in it, as my brother has always been
                deeply invested in building computers, which he has spent plenty of time showing me small aspects of
                the
                process.</p>
            <p>I attended Gymea Technology High School, but despite the name, we didnt learn much code. I enjoyed my

                High School but I am also very happy that it is over</p>
            <p> I have completed Programming 1, am currently studying Applications programming, and have done a short
